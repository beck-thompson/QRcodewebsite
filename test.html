<h3>Reading the data</h3>
<p>In the image below you can see how the data is ordered! Starting from the bottom right, there is first a "Enc" section followed by a "Len" section.</p>
<p>The "Enc" square just indicates what type of data is stored in the QR code! Almost all of the time it will just be text so we are going to skip this. [Maybe talk about what it should look like if text?]</p>
<p>The "Len" section simply indicates the length of the data / how many characters are stored. If I stored "www.google.com" it should say 14.</p>
<p>The rest of the rectangles contain the data for each letter with an ending square and then the data correction parts.</p>

<p>Now that you know what each section means you need to be able to <i>read</i> the data in them.</p>
<p>The first step is to know what order to read the bits is! The image shows what direction has which order</p>
<p>After knowing the order, you simply use overlay this diagram and add up all the 1 (black) squares!</p>
